# AutoTOC
Standalone program to create the PCConsoleTOC.bin files for ME3 and Mass Effect Legendary Edition.

Run from the command line, just pass it the root ME3 folder or .exe, and it will generate a TOC for the base game and all DLCs.
eg. .\AutoTOC.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3"

You can also drag a game executable file directly onto AutoTOC in Windows Explorer to TOC.

You can use the registry detection feature with the -r flag and the game you're trying to TOC.

eg: .\AutoTOC.exe -r LE2
